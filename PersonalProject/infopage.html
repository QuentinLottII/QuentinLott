	<p> My name is Quentin Lott II. I am a 19 college student who is currently attending Central Michigan University. I
		am an IT major, and I play competitive Overwatch on the school's eSports team. </p>
	<p> This summer, I am currently working for Journi. I worked with them last year and learned HTML and CSS. I hope to
		learn more this year. </p>

    <p> Throughout my many years of work and schooling, I have acquired a series
        of soft and hard skills, and personal attributes that still stick with me, and still aid me with
        normal everyday functions.</p>

	<h3> Job path </h3>
	<p> Within the next five years, I see myself working at an exisiting big tech company, or starting my own IT
		company. In order to get there, I'll need to finish college with <i> at least </i> a bachelor's degree in IT. I
		can always get my master's degree when I'm ready. </p>

    <p> I am a graduate and Honor Roll student of Renaissance High School as of

    <p> I have previously worked with GDYT over the past 4 years at various posts.
    I have worked Customer Service at the Samaritan Center, which entailed helping the 
    patrons of the building go where they need to, as well as answering calls and connecting callers to their
    needed departments.

    This is also my second year working at JOURNi. I worked with CSS and HTML with last year's group, and 
    for our last project, we were split off into groups and had to make a website idea to present to Google. </p>
